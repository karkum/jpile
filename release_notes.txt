    FIXED issue where the @Enumerated annotation was not being used and Object.toString() was being used instead of Enum.name(). Before, all enum values were appended with Object.toString(), but with this fix ordinal is used for all cases but when @Enumerated(EnumType.STRING) is specified.
    FIXED issue with finding methods that are annotated with @Column. Now if a parent class has the same method name but different return type, it will not incorrectly include that as a method that has an @Column annotation.
New in 1.7.2
    FIXED issue where persisted fields of type java.util.Date were losing or gaining granularity. The javax.persistence.Temporal annotation is required for all persisted fields of type java.util.Date.
